This project provides the means to bootstrap fully functional
puppet systems.

The project will eventually be packaged for distribution,
so only the bare requirements to get puppet running should be
included here.  This project will be responsible for bringing
up more up to date suites of tools like puppet 2.6.0.

Please report issues with this project at:
 * http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/modules
 * Sign in to file a new issue ticket

The use cases of these systems are:
 * Production. puppet master, dashboard, etc...
 * Evaluation. puppet for exploring new versions and features.
 * Testing.  Execute performance tests against arbitrary puppet versions.
 * Demonstrations.  Create virtual machines or enviornments for demons.
 * Training.  Similar to demonstrations, but distributable to students.
 * Integration.  Provide a software stack that's tested and integrated well.

The goals of this project:
 * Ease of use.  Customization should be straight forward.
 * Follow best practices.  Module standards, documentation, etc...
 * Publish modules and code to the Forge to help the community.
 * Provide a stable software stack for the community.
 * Mitigate issues integrating projects like rubygems, passenger, etc..
 * Provide clear documentation and solutions to common problems.
